# The Boot Certificate Chain (BCC)

The Boot Certificate Chain (BCC) is an application of the Open Profile for DICE
used by Android that conforms to the specification and goes further to more
strictly define the configuration descriptor.

A [CDDL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8610) definition of the BCC can be
found int the [KeyMint AIDL definitions](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:hardware/interfaces/security/keymint/aidl/android/hardware/security/keymint/ProtectedData.aidl).
